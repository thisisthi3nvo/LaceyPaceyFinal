**Product Description (Pitch) & Reflection**

Every year, tens of thousands of people suffer foot injuries that could have been prevented with timely intervention. According to the CDC, 60% of foot injuries are preventable with early action, yet most people only notice problems when pain or disability sets in. In sports alone, 15% of injuries affect the foot, with the highest rates in activities like gymnastics, cross-country, and soccer, and common issues ranging from contusions and plantar fascia injuries to metatarsal fractures. These injuries not only sideline athletes but also impact workers, with average workplace foot injury costs exceeding $15,000 per incident and significant lost productivity.

**Lacey Pacey** is designed to break this cycle of reactive care. By embedding advanced sensors in everyday footwear, Lacey Pacey continuously tracks temperature, pressure, steps, and pace—key metrics that signal the earliest signs of inflammation, poor circulation, or abnormal gait. The system’s predictive analytics use this data to alert users when their foot health is trending toward risk, providing actionable recommendations before a minor issue becomes a major setback. The intuitive mobile app translates complex sensor data into a simple green/yellow/red status, empowering users to take charge of their foot health in real time.

What makes Lacey Pacey personally compelling to me is its potential to democratize preventive healthcare. As someone passionate about the intersection of technology and well-being, I’ve seen firsthand how overlooked foot injuries can derail lives—whether it’s an athlete missing a season, a nurse forced off the floor, or a diabetic patient facing serious complications. Lacey Pacey isn’t just a gadget; it’s a proactive partner in daily life, offering peace of mind and a path to healthier, more active living for everyone.
