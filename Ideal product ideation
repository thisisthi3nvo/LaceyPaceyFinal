Consumer Case Study
Sarah, a 52-year-old nurse with diabetes, used Lacey Pacey to monitor foot temperature and pressure during 12-hour shifts. After receiving a "yellow" alert for elevated pressure on her left heel, she adjusted her footwear and avoided a potential ulcer. Over 6 months, her foot health improved from "caution" to "healthy" status.

Vertical
Health Tech/Wearables: Focused on preventive healthcare and fitness optimization.

Target Audience
Diabetics: 463M+ globally at risk for foot ulcers.

Athletes: Runners, hikers, and gym-goers seeking injury prevention.

Occupational Users: Nurses, teachers, and retail workers on their feet daily.

Why It’s Compelling
Proactive Care: Alerts users before injuries occur (vs. reactive solutions).

Medical-Grade Insights: Comparable to clinical systems (e.g., Orpyx Sensory Insoles) at 1/3 the cost.

Seamless Integration: Works with existing footwear and syncs to smartphones.

Price Justification
Cost Savings:	Prevents $10K–$30K ulcer treatment costs.
Competitors:	Orpyx ($500+), SmartMat ($199 for basic pressure mapping).
